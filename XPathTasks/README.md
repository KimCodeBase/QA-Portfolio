<h1 align="center">XPath and HTML Locator Exercises</h1>

<p align="center">
    Welcome to the XPath and HTML locator practice area! Here, I‚Äôm developing my skills in creating precise locators for various web elements using Selenium.

<h2>üìÇ Folder Contents</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>nested_complex_document.html</strong>: A complex HTML structure I‚Äôm using to practice writing XPath expressions for more challenging scenarios. This file includes multiple sections, like "Our Services" and "Our Team," with nested elements and dropdown menus.</li>
    <li><strong>sample.html</strong>: A simple HTML page I created to practice locating elements by ID and CSS selectors. It includes an input field and button for interactive testing with Selenium.</li>
    <li><strong>xpath_answers.md</strong>: My solutions to various XPath tasks, demonstrating how I approached each locator challenge within the HTML files. It includes specific XPath expressions for different elements.</li>
</ul>

<h2>üìù Practice Goals</h2>

<p>With these exercises, I'm aiming to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Master different XPath techniques, such as absolute and relative paths, and learn to navigate complex HTML structures.</li>
    <li>Effectively locate elements based on attributes, text content, and hierarchical structure.</li>
    <li>Strengthen my skills in creating reliable locators for real-world testing scenarios using Selenium.</li>
</ul>

<h2>üí° How I Approach These Exercises</h2>

<p>To solve these exercises, I follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
    <li>First, I open <code>sample.html</code> or <code>nested_complex_document.html</code> in a browser to visualize the structure and get familiar with the layout.</li>
    <li>Then, I write and test different XPath or CSS selectors in my Selenium scripts to interact with the elements on the page.</li>
    <li>If I need to verify or compare solutions, I refer to <code>xpath_answers.md</code>, where I've documented the XPath expressions I created for each task.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thank you for checking out my XPath and HTML locator exercises! This folder is part of my journey in building a solid foundation for Selenium automation.</p>
